I hold a BSc in Biochemistry and an MTech in Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology, I leverage data to drive insights and stimulate organisational growth. As a certified Data Analyst and Data Scientist, I possess extensive experience in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, utilizing tools such as Python, Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Bash scripts.

My expertise lies in building machine learning and deep learning models, with a focus on transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. I am deeply committed to harnessing the power of data to inform decisions, optimize processes, and create sustainable growth.

Check my [DataCamp Portfolio](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/augustinecemmanuel) where I have completed a combined 40+ courses and projects related to Data Science, experimental design, machine learning and deep learning.

I am always open to collaborations and new opportunities that push the boundaries of data science and analysis.

**Let's work together to unlock the full potential of your data.**
